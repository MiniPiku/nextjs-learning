This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Authentication

This application supports both traditional email/password authentication and Google OAuth authentication:

1. **Email/Password Login**: Users can sign up and log in using their email and password.
2. **Google OAuth**: Users can authenticate using their Google account.

After successful authentication, the JWT token and user ID are stored in localStorage and automatically included in API requests.
